# Single Sign On (SSO) using OKTA OpenID Connect (OIDC) and AWS Cognito to access AWS Resources

This JavaScript app allows users to sign in to OKTA using their username and password and enables them to access any AWS Resource. I used OKTA as the Identity Provider, but similar steps can be applied for any other Identity Providers too.
